        <h1>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) And How Does It Work?</h1>
       
   



   <p>
    About a few years ago, if you were planning a trip to Goa and wanted to know the weather or the best route or any other such important query, you might have to ask someone who had already been there for accurate answers or instructions. But, now we live in the world of artificial intelligence, where each and every information can be fetched within seconds. With all this hi-tech technology, AI- enabled voice or speech recognition, google maps, self-driving cars, there is no doubt that “Artificial Intelligence” or “AI” has made our life much simpler than we could imagine a few years ago.

From the moment you wake up, check your phone, or binge watch any Netflix recommended series, you are making optimum use of AI every day of your life. 

So, what is the true meaning of artificial intelligence or AI, what are its benefits and how does it actually work in real-life world? This read has all such answers. </p>
   <p><strong>What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
    </strong><br/>
    Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science which performs tasks with the help of smart machines and various applications, with or without human cognitive functions or supervisions — such as interpreting speech, playing games and identifying patterns.

Broadly speaking, AI represents a computerized machine with human -level intelligence, loaded with all sorts of cognitive abilities specifically programmed to perform various tasks.</p><br/>

<p><strong>How Does Artificial Intelligence AI Work?
</strong>
  
The aim of AI science is to create a computer system which can model human behavior in such a way that it can be thus used for solving complex issues with the help of human-like thinking processes.<br/> AI systems work by merging bulky sets of data with intelligent processing algorithms and run through multiple tasks extremely quickly in very little time.

For this, AI is powered with main tools such as “machine learning” and “deep learning” and performs the given tasks, almost in a similar manner to the human mind.<br/>

Deep learning refers to a form of machine learning, and machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, which further forms the foundation of AI.

    <strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong><br/>
    Deep learning is a form of machine learning which uses artificial neural networks to process information and thus find inferences or results. A specific type of machine learning that allows AI to learn and improve by processing data. Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks which mimic biological neural networks in the human brain to process information, find connections between the data, and come up with inferences, or results based on positive and negative reinforcement. We will discuss more about “deep learning” later in our article.

  On the other hand, “neural networks” function like networks of neurons present in the human brain, which allows AI to process very large data sets and allows the machine to go “deep” in drawing references, making connections and weighing input for the efficient results.

Other than ML and DL, AI systems require robotics, cognitive computing skills, language processing and computer vision which allows computer models to imitate the way that a human brain works while performing a complex task.
<br/><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong><br/>
It refers to a particular application of AI which lets computer systems or programs grasp automatically and show results based on experience. ML algorithm works on fed data and uses different statistical techniques which allows AI to discover various patterns in data and thus expand the results of the task.</p>

<p><strong>What Do You Mean By Deep Learning AI?
</strong><br/>
Deep learning is a very important and crucial component of artificial intelligence which includes statistical data and predictive learning. It is a subdivision of machine learning which uses neural networks to simulate the behavior of the human brain. The neural networks are stimulated by the function of the human brain and they are made up of large amounts of data which works in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner.

The models based on deep learning are able to grasp directly from this fed data, thus such models become well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

Deep learning makes use of the labeled data to classify or to make accurate calculations, which might require some kind of human intervention i.e, to put that data correctly. Thus, deep learning can be thought of as a way to automate predictive analytics. While conventional machine learning algorithms are linear and direct, deep learning algorithms are set in a hierarchy of abstract representations and various concepts

In the human brain, nearly billions and billions of neurons are connected all together. The main challenge is to recreate this neuron artificially in a computer system which consists of various nodes and neurons altogether.</p>
  
  





<p><strong>Advantages of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong><br/>
  Artificial intelligence or AI, is a revolutionary achievement of the branch of computer science in its true sense. Gradually, AI has become a core component of modern software over the years and decades to come. Current and topical discoveries in AI development have stemmed mostly from “machine learning” and “deep learning” algorithms.

Instead of feeding a particular set of data or information from AI to mimic or follow, the latest techniques in AI use a large set of datasets and then perform predictive analysis.

For example, live chatbots based on AI are based on information comprising recordings of human conversation, which is in turn collected from various messenger apps to learn the way how human responds, and thus come up with appropriate responses

</p>
<p><strong>More Accuracy and Precision:</strong><br/>
  The main benefit of AI is that it is helpful in lessening human errors and thus promises a high level of accuracy and precision in their outcome. The decisions taken by AI based systems are based on past data or information and a certain set of algorithms. If AI is programmed properly, then there are literally no chances of any error.
  <br/><strong>No Risks of Human Lives: </strong>
  AI can easily overcome many risks which might have fallen upon any human being by letting AI robots work for them. With the help of an AI robot, all perilous tasks can be performed via them without any direct human involvement.  

For instance, AI robots can be used for diffusing a bomb, exploring the deep ocean, where machines can easily work and survive but such tasks can cause enormous amounts of risks to human beings.
<br/><strong>Available Round-the-clock:  </strong>
AI based systems can work anytime in a day. As AI systems do not need any break and thus can work endlessly and perform multiple tasks with most accurate outcomes. AI based systems or robots can even perform tedious and repetitive tasks with ease.

  <strong>Serving Customers Digitally:</strong> Several new-age companies have started using AI based digital assistants, which help them to deliver user-based content timely. Now, companies can create their own chatbots which help them to answer all the customer queries much on time.

<br/><strong>Unbiased Approach:</strong> Artificial intelligence does not work on the basis of emotions and sentiments, thus helps in delivering highly practical and rational decisions. A huge advantage of artificial Intelligence is that it doesn’t have any biased views, which ensures more accurate decision-making.

<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong><br/>
  The modern field of AI has a long list of advantages and disadvantages. Despite potential risks, AI enabled application and utility have increased over years along with the continuous improvements and breakthroughs in technology. Artificial intelligence has paved its way into exploring different kinds of sectors such as healthcare, customer-centric businesses, education, finance, manufacturing, banking, security, transportation, among many others.
  It’s worth noting that artificial intelligence is here to stay and stands to create more job opportunities, some of which have not even been invented.<br/><br/>
