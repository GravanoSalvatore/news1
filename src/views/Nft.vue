        <h1>WHAT ARE NFTS AND WHY SHOULD THE ART WORLD TAKE NOTE</h1>
        <p>Since March, there’s a good chance that the acronym you’ve heard most frequently is NFT. But just because something is topping Google trends doesn’t mean it’s immediately clear what it is or why we should be paying attention to it. Let’s dive into why NFTs are shaking up the art world and how this affects creators of all kinds.</p>
   <!-- <img class="img" src="../assets/defi.jpeg"> -->


   



   <p><strong>What is an NFT?</strong><br/>
    An NFT is a digital collectible asset such as a piece of art or a trading card (or something even more at home on the internet such as a meme or a tweet) that provides a record of its ownership and authenticity and thus allows it to be sold and collected like a Picasso at Christie’s. Because they model the scarcity and uniqueness of traditional art works, they’re also quickly becoming an investment vehicle.

This tweet-turned-NFTt, the Twitter founder’s first entry on his social media network, recently sold for over $2 million. </p>
   <p>HOW DOES THAT WORK?
NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible means non-interchangeable. Unlike the way one US dollar is exchangeable for another US dollar or one bitcoin is the same as another bitcoin, each digital work and its corresponding token that holds the record of its value is unique. Because NFTs and the marketplaces they trade on are linked to the blockchain (the digital database that supports cryptocurrencies with a public ledger), these files now have a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership.  

When you buy an NFT, you’re getting a digital file as well as a certificate of authenticity. Though there might be other copies of the file out there on the internet, the NFT system provides proof that you own the one that matters. Can you still download a copy of Beeple’s record-setting “Everydays - The First 5000 Days”? Sure, just right-click it like any other digital image. But can you claim to own it? Only if you were the $69.3 million winning bidder with the corresponding entry in the blockchain’s digital ledger.</p><br/>
  <div class="defi-logo">

<p><strong>What could this mean for creators?</strong><br/>
    Similar to the ways that the internet has democratized the spread of information, art, and culture, this digital revolution empowers the creators of digital art who have seen their work bounce around the internet with little to no attribution let alone payment. Whereas before there was no outlet for some of these online-only creations, NFTs have provided a legitimate marketplace.

Anyone (yes, even you) can create and market an NFT on specialized marketplaces such as OpenSea. As with other collectibles, notoriety will help set the price. If your Aunt Christina and Georgia O’Keefe use the same materials to create the same sized painting, it’s pretty obvious whose auction will start with a higher bid, but that doesn’t mean that up-and-coming creators can’t take advantage of this rising tide. Much the same way that other creator-centric platforms like Patreon and Substack allow artists and writers to foster their own communities and receive direct support from their patrons and subscribers, NFTs offer a chance to form a special (and potentially lucrative) bond with early superfans.

  <p>
    Take Beeple, now one of the most valuable living artists in the world, for example. His record-setting NFT was the result of a solitary quest to publish a new piece of digital art every day for 14 years. Along the way, the most he ever sold an individual print for was $100, but he did amass over 2 million followers on his social profiles. As the NFT wave started to crest, he found himself in prime position to capitalize on his years-long campaign.

    <strong>Are there downsides?</strong><br/>

Because of their reliance on the digital power of the blockchain, NFTs consume a lot of energy and are being criticized for their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. There are alternatives in the works that require less energy, but as long as NFTs work closely with the cryptocurrency ethereum, they will take a toll on the planet. </p>
 
<div class="defi-logo">

<p>
    Aside from environmental concerns, the meteoric rise of popularity in this form has seen huge brands like The New York Times and Taco Bell jump on the bandwagon, creating NFTs just for the sake of being part of the conversation. Because of the unique nature of each NFT, Taco Bell’s entry might not directly impact the average illustrator making art for art’s sake, but it does provide a clear example of ways the form may be exploited by larger players.

Wherever NFTs go from here, they’ve previewed a future where more digital creators can sustain themselves on their art alone. And while it’s possible that an artistic titan like Jeff Koons or David Hockney won’t be able to resist the current upside of NFTs and decide to mint their own work, it’s already true that established digital artists are in a great position to market their work to online communities who appreciate it just as much for its artistic value as its new investment potential.</p>

<p><strong>How to Buy NFTs</strong><br/>
  If you’re keen to start your own NFT collection, you’ll need to acquire some key items:

First, you’ll need to get a digital wallet that allows you to store NFTs and cryptocurrencies. You’ll likely need to purchase some cryptocurrency, like Ether, depending on what currencies your NFT provider accepts. You can buy crypto using a credit card on platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, eToro and even PayPal and Robinhood now. You’ll then be able to move it from the exchange to your wallet of choice.

You’ll want to keep fees in mind as you research options. Most exchanges charge at least a percentage of your transaction when you buy crypto.</p>
  
  

<p><strong>Popular NFT Marketplaces</strong><br/>
  <img style="width:100%" src="../assets/nft nft.jpeg"/><br/>
  Once you’ve got your wallet set up and funded, there’s no shortage of NFT sites to shop. Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are:

  <a href="https://opensea.io/" target="_blank"><strong>OpenSea.io</strong></a>: This peer-to-peer platform bills itself a purveyor of “rare digital items and collectibles.” To get started, all you need to do is create an account to browse NFT collections. You can also sort pieces by sales volume to discover new artists.

  <a href="https://rarible.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rarible</strong></a>: Similar to OpenSea, Rarible is a democratic, open marketplace that allows artists and creators to issue and sell NFTs. RARI tokens issued on the platform enable holders to weigh in on features like fees and community rules.

  <a href="https://foundation.app/" target="_blank"><strong>Foundation</strong></a>: Here, artists must receive “upvotes” or an invitation from fellow creators to post their art. The community’s exclusivity and cost of entry—artists must also purchase “gas” to mint NFTs—means it may boast higher-caliber artwork. For instance, Nyan Cat creator Chris Torres sold the NFT on the Foundation platform. It may also mean higher prices — not necessarily a bad thing for artists and collectors seeking to capitalize, assuming the demand for NFTs remains at current levels, or even increases over time.

Although these platforms and others are host to thousands of NFT creators and collectors, be sure you do your research carefully before buying. Some artists have fallen victim to impersonators who have listed and sold their work without their permission.

In addition, the verification processes for creators and NFT listings aren’t consistent across platforms — some are more stringent than others. OpenSea and Rarible, for example, do not require owner verification for NFT listings. Buyer protections appear to be sparse at best, so when shopping for NFTs, it may be best to keep the old adage “caveat emptor” (let the buyer beware) in mind.

<p><strong>Should You Buy NFTs?</strong><br/>
  Just because you can buy NFTs, does that mean you should? It depends, Yu says.

“NFTs are risky because their future is uncertain, and we don’t yet have a lot of history to judge their performance,” she notes. “Since NFTs are so new, it may be worth investing small amounts to try it out for now.”

In other words, investing in NFTs is a largely personal decision. If you have money to spare, it may be worth considering, especially if a piece holds meaning for you.

But keep in mind, an NFT’s value is based entirely on what someone else is willing to pay for it. Therefore, demand will drive the price rather than fundamental, technical or economic indicators, which typically influence stock prices and at least generally form the basis for investor demand.

All this means, an NFT may resale for less than you paid for it. Or you may not be able to resell it at all if no one wants it.

</p>
<p><br/>
  NFTs are also subject to capital gains taxes—just like when you sell stocks at a profit. Since they’re considered collectibles, however, they may not receive the preferential long-term capital gains rates stocks do and may even be taxed at a higher collectibles tax rate, though the IRS has not yet ruled what NFTs are considered for tax purposes. Bear in mind, the cryptocurrencies used to purchase the NFT may also be taxed if they’ve increased in value since you bought them, meaning you may want to check in with a tax professional when considering adding NFTs to your portfolio.

  That said, approach NFTs just like you would any investment: Do your research, understand the risks—including that you might lose all of your investing dollars—and if you decide to take the plunge, proceed with a healthy dose of caution.<br/>
  <strong><a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/" target="_blank">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a></strong><br/>
  often colloquially called Bored Apes, Bored Ape or BAYC, is a non-fungible token (NFT) collection built on the Ethereum blockchain. The collection features profile pictures of cartoon apes that are procedurally generated by an algorithm.

The parent company of Bored Ape Yacht Club is Yuga Labs.[1] The project launched in April 2021. Owners of a Bored Ape NFT are granted access to a private online club, exclusive in-person events, and intellectual property rights for the image.

<p><br/>
  As of 2022, Yuga Labs was valued at US$4 billion. This is due in large part to the sales of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection totalling over US$1 billion as well as high value auction sales from their investor, now defunct FTX.Various celebrities have purchased these non-fungible tokens, including Justin Bieber, Snoop Dogg, Gwyneth Paltrow and other.

By July 2023, the floor price of Bored Ape NFTs had decreased 88% from its April 2022 peak.
